## Code explained

First, we check if the walls list is empty. If it is, we return 0 as there is no water to be retained.

We initialize two arrays, left_max and right_max, each of length n (where n is the length of the walls list). The left_max array will store the maximum wall height seen so far from the left side, and the right_max array will store the maximum wall height seen so far from the right side.

We iterate through the walls list from left to right, updating the left_max array at each step to store the maximum wall height seen so far.

We iterate through the walls list from right to left, updating the right_max array at each step to store the maximum wall height seen so far.

We iterate through the walls list again, and for each wall, we calculate the minimum of its corresponding values in the left_max and right_max arrays. This represents the maximum height of water that can be retained by that wall. If this height is greater than the height of the wall itself, we add the difference to the total_water variable.

Finally, we return the total_water variable, which represents the total amount of water that can be retained by the given set of walls.
